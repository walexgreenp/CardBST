# CardBST
"Game" simulation. Program reads 2 .txt files, takes data, inserts data into Binary Searh Tree, and compares data. 

# What I learned
* Solidified my understanding of BSTs, and when their usage is most efficient.
* Improved my skills with pointers, and memory allocation/deallocation on the heap.
* Gained experience with using .txt files, as well as translating data into easier to use values.
